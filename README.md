## Title

The Impact of Timing of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) on ICU Beds Occupancy During the 2020 COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy

## Objective

Our goal in this project is to advise Italian policymakers on the optimal timeline for interventions to prevent hospital
overcrowding, protect citizens by curbing the virusâ€™s spread at the right time, and reduce public health costs for the government.

## Research Question
How does implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions on days 5, 10, 30, and 50 after the first detected case of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy affect ICU bed occupancy?
