## Title

The Impact of Timing of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) on ICU Beds Occupancy During the 2020 COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy

## Objective

Our goal in this project is to advise Italian policymakers on the optimal timeline for interventions to prevent hospital
overcrowding, protect citizens by curbing the virusâ€™s spread at the right time, and reduce public health costs for the government.

## Research Question
How does implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions on days 5, 10, 30, and 50 after the first detected case of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy affect ICU bed occupancy?

## Description Data

The dataset containing historical data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and hospital bed occupancy has been sourced from the Italian National Institute of Health. Our dataset, named \texttt{hospitalization.csv}, includes 150 rows and 4 columns. Each row corresponds to a specific day starting from \emph{February 24, 2020} and includes the following columns:
