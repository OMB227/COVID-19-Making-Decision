## Title

The Impact of Timing of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) on ICU Beds Occupancy During the 2020 COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy

## Objective

Our goal in this project is to advise Italian policymakers on the optimal timeline for interventions to prevent hospital
overcrowding, protect citizens by curbing the virusâ€™s spread at the right time, and reduce public health costs for the government.

## Research Question
How does implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions on days 5, 10, 30, and 50 after the first detected case of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy affect ICU bed occupancy?

## Description Data

The dataset containing historical data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and hospital bed occupancy has been sourced from the Italian National Institute of Health. Our dataset, named \texttt{hospitalization.csv}, includes 150 rows and 4 columns. Each row corresponds to a specific day starting from \emph{February 24, 2020} and includes the following columns:

## Differential Equation

\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta \frac{SI}{N} \\
\frac{dE}{dt} &= \beta \frac{SI}{N} - \sigma E \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \sigma E - \alpha I \\
\frac{dB_N}{dt} &= \alpha I - (\theta + \gamma_1) B_N \\
\frac{dB_{ICU}}{dt} &= \gamma_1 B_N - (\lambda_1 + \delta) B_{ICU}
\end{align*}
