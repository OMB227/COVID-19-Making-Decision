## Title

The Impact of Timing of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) on ICU Beds Occupancy During the 2020 COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy

## Objective

Our goal in this project is to advise Italian policymakers on the optimal timeline for interventions to prevent hospital
overcrowding, protect citizens by curbing the virusâ€™s spread at the right time, and reduce public health costs for the government.

## Research Question
How does implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions on days 5, 10, 30, and 50 after the first detected case of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy affect ICU bed occupancy?

## Dataset Description

The dataset containing historical data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and hospital bed occupancy has been sourced from the Italian National Institute of Health. Our dataset, named `hospitalization.csv`, includes 150 rows and 4 columns. Each row corresponds to a specific day starting from *February 24, 2020* and includes the following columns:

- **Time**: The date of the recorded data (daily).
- **Excluded_ICU_cases**: The number of patients hospitalized in normal beds (non-ICU).
- **ICU_cases**: The number of patients hospitalized in ICU beds.
- **Total_cases**: The total number of hospitalized patients, combining both normal bed and ICU bed hospitalizations.

## Model

The stochastic SEIR model will be implemented using historical data from Milan's COVID-19 outbreak. The parameters ($\beta$, $\sigma$, $\alpha$, $\theta$, $\gamma_1$, $\lambda_1$, $\delta$)


The model will simulate the progression of the pandemic over 150 days for the first wave, analyzing the impact of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on hospital bed capacity.

Parameters:
- $N$ is the total population
- $\beta$: Transmission rate
- $\sigma$: Rate at which exposed individuals become infectious
- $\alpha$: Rate at which infectious individuals are hospitalized
- $\theta$: Rate at which non-ICU hospitalized individuals recover
- $\gamma_1$: Rate at which non-ICU hospitalized individuals are moved to the ICU
- $\lambda_1$: Rate at which ICU individuals recover
- $\delta$: Death rate in the ICU -->



### Differential Equations

The model is governed by the following system of differential equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta \frac{SI}{N} \\
\frac{dE}{dt} &= \beta \frac{SI}{N} - \sigma E \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \sigma E - \alpha I \\
\frac{dB_N}{dt} &= \alpha I - (\theta + \gamma_1) B_N \\
\frac{dB_{ICU}}{dt} &= \gamma_1 B_N - (\lambda_1 + \delta) B_{ICU}
\end{align*}
$$



## Usage

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vilmo18/COVID-19-Making-Decision
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd SEIR-Milan-COVID19
    ```

## Analysis

The simulation will provide insights into the impact of various NPIs on hospital bed capacity. Results will be visualized to show the progression of the pandemic under different scenarios.
